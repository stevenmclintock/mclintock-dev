Hi, I'm Steven! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Scottish software developer who lives in 
[Stratford, Ontario](https://www.stratford.ca/). I grew up in 
[Glasgow, Scotland](https://www.visitglasgow.com) where I went to 
[Glasgow Caledonian University](https://www.gcu.ac.uk) and 
graduated with a BSc in Internet Software Development in 2006.

In 2012 I met my wife and we got married in 2016. In 2017 we immigrated 
to Canada and a few years later we had our son, Miles.

I began my career working for the environmental charity 
[Keep Scotland Beautiful](https://www.keepscotlandbeautiful.org/) and 
have since worked for multiple international tech companies and 
award-winning digital agencies, such as [1Password](https://1password.com), 
[Crawford & Company](https://www.crawco.ca) and 
[Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com).

In my spare time I'm usually found in a quiet spot listening to a podcast, 
working on a DIY project for our 1960's house, or spending time with my family.
