Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic I blogged _surprisingly_ often. In early 2019 
I created a personal website for myself using the domain name 
[kiltandcode.com](https://mclintock.dev/2021/03/25/two-years-of-kilt-and-code/) 
and wrote a few blog posts to get started. When the lockdowns began and I found I 
had plenty of free time on my hands _(with no toddler watching Ms Rachel in the background)_, 
I wrote ...a lot.

    alt='Kilt and Code and 2021'
    caption='Kilt and Code in 2021'
%}

By mid-2021, with the pandemic almost coming to an end, I had somehow amassed 31 
_(mostly)_ long form blog posts and I had somehow exceeded my goal, a whopping 
10,000 visitors a month!

    caption='Reaching my goal of 10,000 visitors a month'
%}

With my goal met and the pandemic coming to an end, I began having less spare time 
and the website began to stagnate. My wife was also pregnant _(yay!)_, so I 
figured it was about time to shut it down and come back to it later... whenever 
that would be.

Well, my son is about to turn two years old in a few weeks _(where does the time go!)_, 
and I'm beginning to get the itch _(and the free time!)_ to write again. There's a 
ton of things I've learnt at [1Password](https://1password.com) so far that 
I'd like to turn into a post or two, mostly around the topic of web extensions. 
I also like the idea of writing from the perspective of a software developer who's at 
the ripe old age of 40, almost two decades into his career.

Here's to writing about all the lessons I've learnt so far, and to all the lessons 
I've still to learn.
